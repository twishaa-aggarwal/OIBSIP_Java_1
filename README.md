# Java Online Reservation System

This is a basic Java program that simulates an online train ticket reservation system. It runs on the command line and uses simple concepts like loops, conditionals, and user input.

## What it does

- Asks for a user ID and password
- Lets you:
  - Reserve a ticket (enter name and train name)
  - Cancel a ticket (by entering the PNR)
  - Exit the system

## How to run

1. Make sure you have Java installed.
2. Save the code in a file called `Welcome.java`.
3. Open terminal or command prompt and navigate to the folder.
4. Compile and run:


## Login Details

- User ID: Twisha16  
- Password: 1234567

(These are just for testing.)

## Notes

- The program doesn’t save anything to a file or database.
- PNR is fixed at `275990` and only one ticket can be active at a time.
- It's made just to demonstrate simple Java logic.
